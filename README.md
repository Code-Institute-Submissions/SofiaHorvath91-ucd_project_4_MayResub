# MyAPPocalypse (UCD Project 4)
Ready to hit the road when your world ends ?

Hopefully the time will never come when all you know is gone and suddenly you find yourself on the road in this big world, but it is never a bad idea to be prepared!
MyAPPocalypse helps you put together your bag for any possible scenario - no matter if you are on the Antarctis or in the Sahara, be assured you have a bag to grab when it is time to leave behind your place.
Here you may define the parameters of your bag (local conditions or special company like child or pet) and then select from the recommended items to fill it. If you are on the roll, you may also directly consult the latest offers of Amazon while cherry-picking from the proposed items, and if you find that something is missing from the list, you can recommend it and once approved, it will be available for selection.
Sign up (even with your social media accounts) and look around, prepare your bag and leave your thoughts for further improvements to raise the odds against vis-major events!

### 6. Style
* Design & Colours
  * When planning the project, I wanted a very simple design, not too grim but neither too playful, so I decided to rely on a visually appealing, reddish background image with matching theme, and white text with black border to ease the effect of the heavy subject. I wanted to avoid too much black or too dark theme as I wanted to emphasize the hope and the chance you give to yourself, not the sad conditions what give the context.
* Font Selection
  * The main font type was chosen with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and is used across the whole of the website: [Cagliostro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cagliostro?query=Cagliostro). This is a well readable font type which yet gives a practical, yet personal feeling feeling which I found suitable for the subject of the site : the topic itself is pragmatic, but the circonstances are very personal.
### 7. Code Structure and Database
* Code Structure\
The project is consisted of one application, MyAPPocalypse, built by using the Django Framework. The business logic is executed by this application, based on the ucd_projct_4 settings, using the statis resources like HTML page frame / CSS stylesheet / Javascript-jQuery script.\
The application is completed by the following files/directories :
  * ucd_project_4: Containing settings.py(Settings) and urls.py(Website urls)
  * templates: Containing the base.html as HTML pages' frame
  * static: CSS files, Javascript files, images
  * node_modules : Node installation for Javascript testing with Jest
  * package.json : Json file created for Javascrip testing with Jest
  * manage.py: Main python file for starting the website
  * README.md: Readme documentation
  * Procfile: To run the application
  * Requirements.txt: Containing the python libraries installed
* Database\
The website is a data-centric one with frontend built with HTML, Javascript, CSS along with Bootstrap framework.
The backend consists of Python built with the Django framework with a database of a Postgres for the deployed Heroku version (Production)
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an open source object-relational database system with powerful features
[SQLLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database was used for local development and testing.
* Models\
The following models were created to represent the database model structure for the website.\
* User Model
  * The User model contains information about the user. It is part of the Django social auth library. As no particular customization was needed ofr User model, get_user_model() lazy loading ws used.
* Climate
  * Capture details of possible climates to associate to the road where the bag will be used
  * Connected to Items (via ManyToMany relation) / Bags (via ForeignKey relation)
  * ClimateSerializer is used to pass Climate to Item model
* Landform

### 5. Manual tests
* Desktop\
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge: pages are working fine and have the corresponding style, social login works as expected.
* Mobile\
Tested with Samsung A5, Galaxy Fold, iPhone 5, and iPad, and webpage works well, responsive as intended and no style deformations.
* Mozilla Developer Tools\
Tested for available devices, webpage works well, responsive as intended, no style deformations and no error messages in Pycharm debug tool.
### 6. Accessibility tests
The pages available before login were verified about accessibility using [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) as Wave cannot handle login feature. Few stylistic errors found (low contrast errors for color), alerts related to heading elements hierarchy, one error for empty header (filled out by Django). As other pages are very similar in terms of HTML-Styling, same results are assumed for them too.

### 7. Bugs and Solution
While building the application, I encountered the difficulty of passing information (Item model records from database) from Django view to Javascript code for display on UI. I found the solution in form of transforming the information to Json value in Django view, passing it to script on HTML page and retrieve it by main Javascript from page script. This slows the site a bit, but no timing-out and information is thus consistent through different technologies.
## Deployment
The site was deployed to Heroku (find it [here](https://vast-shore-97005.herokuapp.com/)) while building it with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and pushing it to GitHub Repository and Heroku via [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
