# MyAPPocalypse (UCD Project 4)
Ready to hit the road when your world ends ?

Hopefully the time will never come when all you know is gone and suddenly you find yourself on the road in this big world, but it is never a bad idea to be prepared!
MyAPPocalypse helps you put together your bag for any possible scenario - no matter if you are on the Antarctis or in the Sahara, be assured you have a bag to grab when it is time to leave behind your place.
Here you may define the parameters of your bag (local conditions or special company like child or pet) and then select from the recommended items to fill it. If you are on the roll, you may also directly consult the latest offers of Amazon while cherry-picking from the proposed items, and if you find that something is missing from the list, you can recommend it and once approved, it will be available for selection.
Sign up (even with your social media accounts) and look around, prepare your bag and leave your thoughts for further improvements to raise the odds against vis-major events!
