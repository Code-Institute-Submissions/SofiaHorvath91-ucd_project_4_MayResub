# MyAPPocalypse (UCD Project 4)
Ready to hit the road when your world ends ?

Hopefully the time will never come when all you know is gone and suddenly you find yourself on the road in this big world, but it is never a bad idea to be prepared!
MyAPPocalypse helps you put together your bag for any possible scenario - no matter if you are on the Antarctis or in the Sahara, be assured you have a bag to grab when it is time to leave behind your place.
Here you may define the parameters of your bag (local conditions or special company like child or pet) and then select from the recommended items to fill it. If you are on the roll, you may also directly consult the latest offers of Amazon while cherry-picking from the proposed items, and if you find that something is missing from the list, you can recommend it and once approved, it will be available for selection.
Sign up (even with your social media accounts) and look around, prepare your bag and leave your thoughts for further improvements to raise the odds against vis-major events!

### 2. Strategy
* Purpose of Project
  * To make sure users have the chance to virtually prepare for a heavy real-life scenario
  * To have users to pack one or more bags with chosen items, depending on user-defined special conditions
  * To allow users leave their toughts and recommendations for further site improvement.
  * To give users an overview and educate them about what is needed in vis-major situations.
### 3. Scope
* I wanted a simple, evident and user-friendly UX experience.
* I wanted clear and informative content.
* I wanted a visually appealing, yet solid design.
* I wanted interesting and thought-provoking site description.
* I wanted smooth and interactive bag-packing and feedback experience.
### 4. Structure

* The navigation bar is clear, fixed, visible and responsive with matching site logo. 
* The content is easy to read, bag packing function and feedback-leaving function are smooth with self-explanatory steps.

### 5. Skeleton
The very basic skeleton of the site was modelled by Wireframes via Balsamiq, and during site development, additional design elements was added for better UX.

### 6. Style
* Design & Colours
  * When planning the project, I wanted a very simple design, not too grim but neither too playful, so I decided to rely on a visually appealing, reddish background image with matching theme, and white text with black border to ease the effect of the heavy subject. I wanted to avoid too much black or too dark theme as I wanted to emphasize the hope and the chance you give to yourself, not the sad conditions what give the context.
* Font Selection
  * The main font type was chosen with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and is used across the whole of the website: [Cagliostro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cagliostro?query=Cagliostro). This is a well readable font type which yet gives a practical, yet personal feeling feeling which I found suitable for the subject of the site : the topic itself is pragmatic, but the circonstances are very personal.
## Features

* __Navigation Bar__
  * Featured on all pages, the navigation bar includes links to all subpages and is identical on each page for smooth navigation. The navbar is fixed and fully responsive on all screen sizes: for smaller devices, a hamburger navbar view is included with the help of Bootstrap for better UX and easier navigation.

  * [Django Unit Tests](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd_project_4/blob/master/static/img/readme/jest_testing_test_suite.PNG)
### 2. Manual tests
* Desktop\
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge: pages are working fine and have the corresponding style, social login works as expected.
* Mobile\
Tested with Samsung A5, Galaxy Fold, iPhone 5, and iPad, and webpage works well, responsive as intended and no style deformations.
* Mozilla Developer Tools\
Tested for available devices, webpage works well, responsive as intended, no style deformations and no error messages in Pycharm debug tool.
### 3. Accessibility tests
The pages available before login were verified about accessibility using [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) as Wave cannot handle login feature. Few stylistic errors found (low contrast errors for color), alerts related to heading elements hierarchy, one error for empty header (filled out by Django). As other pages are very similar in terms of HTML-Styling, same results are assumed for them too.

* [Sign Up Page Wave Result](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd_project_4/blob/master/static/img/readme/wave-signup.PNG)
### 4. Bugs and Solution
While building the application, I encountered the difficulty of passing information (Item model records from database) from Django view to Javascript code for display on UI. I found the solution in form of transforming the information to Json value in Django view, passing it to script on HTML page and retrieve it by main Javascript from page script. This slows the site a bit, but no timing-out and information is thus consistent through different technologies.
## Deployment
The site was deployed to Heroku (find it [here](https://vast-shore-97005.herokuapp.com/)) while building it with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and pushing it to GitHub Repository and Heroku via [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
1.	GitHub repository => Settings => GitHub Pages
2.	Source => Selecting Branch + Folder (main/docs)
3.	With branch/folder selected, the page refreshes to show deployment status
### 1. Forking Repository
By forking the GitHub Repository, the user can copy the original repository in his/her own GitHub account, allowing the user to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository.
1.	Open GitHub => GitHub Repository
2.	Top of Repository => Fork option
3.	Copy of the original repository appears in your GitHub account
### 2. Local Clone
1.	Open GitHub => GitHub Repository
2.	Under Repository name => Clone or download option
3.	Clone Repository using HTTPS => Clone with HTTPS => Copy URL
4.	Open Git Bash
5.	Current working directory => Choose location where you want the directory to be cloned
6.	Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied in Step 3.\
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
7.	Press Enter
