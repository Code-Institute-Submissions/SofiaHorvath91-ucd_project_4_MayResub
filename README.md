# MyAPPocalypse (UCD Project 4)
Ready to hit the road when your world ends ?

Hopefully the time will never come when all you know is gone and suddenly you find yourself on the road in this big world, but it is never a bad idea to be prepared!
MyAPPocalypse helps you put together your bag for any possible scenario - no matter if you are on the Antarctis or in the Sahara, be assured you have a bag to grab when it is time to leave behind your place.
Here you may define the parameters of your bag (local conditions or special company like child or pet) and then select from the recommended items to fill it. If you are on the roll, you may also directly consult the latest offers of Amazon while cherry-picking from the proposed items, and if you find that something is missing from the list, you can recommend it and once approved, it will be available for selection.
Sign up (even with your social media accounts) and look around, prepare your bag and leave your thoughts for further improvements to raise the odds against vis-major events!

### 5. Skeleton
The very basic skeleton of the site was modelled by Wireframes via Balsamiq, and during site development, additional design elements was added for better UX.

### 6. Style
* Design & Colours
  * When planning the project, I wanted a very simple design, not too grim but neither too playful, so I decided to rely on a visually appealing, reddish background image with matching theme, and white text with black border to ease the effect of the heavy subject. I wanted to avoid too much black or too dark theme as I wanted to emphasize the hope and the chance you give to yourself, not the sad conditions what give the context.
* Font Selection
  * The main font type was chosen with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and is used across the whole of the website: [Cagliostro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cagliostro?query=Cagliostro). This is a well readable font type which yet gives a practical, yet personal feeling feeling which I found suitable for the subject of the site : the topic itself is pragmatic, but the circonstances are very personal.
